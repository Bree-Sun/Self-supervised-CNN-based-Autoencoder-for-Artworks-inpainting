# Self-supervised CNN-based Autoencoder for Artworks inpainting
Our goal is to create a useful tool for AI restoration of artworks in museums. The reconstructed artworks could be displayed digitally or be used as an inspiration for manual restoration. The model should also be easily trained on new datasets without requiring extensive computing power or any labelling.
